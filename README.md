Instructions
·	 
·	Directions
o	You have been selected to develop a GUI application called a “Configurator”.  The application allows the user to complete the configuration of a computer system and produce a sales price for the system based on the configuration selected.  The application must meet the minimum operating requirements and specifications as provided below:
·	Operation
o	The user configures the components of a computer system by selecting items from combo boxes, radio buttons, and check boxes.
o	When the user clicks the Calculate button, the application calculates the prices of the system by adding the cost of each selected component to the base price of the system.
o	An option is provided to the user to clear all entries and begin over.
o	As the systems are configured on the “fly”, the program should update the costs automatically to show the user the impact of adding or changing the basic system (running totals)
o	When the user presses the “order” button, the program should display the current configuration in a dialog box of your choice.  The dialog box should show the configuration the user is about to order with pricing and totals.  The user must confirm the configuration before the order is processed.  When the user confirms the order, the order is processed and the order displayed as processed.
o	When the user closes the frame or presses the Exit button, the application exits.
·	Specifications
o	You are free to use whatever layouts and panels you need to design the application.   You can also create any classes you think might be helpful to solve and develop this application. In short, you’re the developer and may use all resources available to you.  The only requirement is: you must use the Java programming language.
